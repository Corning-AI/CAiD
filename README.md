## Overview

**CAiD** is an AI-driven CAD modeling agent that transforms design concepts and natural language descriptions into precise, parametric 3D CAD models. By leveraging advanced AI and machine learning, CAiD streamlines the design process, enabling engineers and designers to focus on innovation rather than manual modeling. Whether you're creating mechanical parts, complex assemblies, or architectural designs, CAiD accelerates your workflow with intelligent automation and real-time optimization.

## Core Features

- **Natural Language to CAD Model Generation**
  - Convert design descriptions and specifications into 3D CAD models using natural language processing
  - Intelligent interpretation of design intent and requirements
  - Automatic parameterization of models for easy modifications

- **Parametric Design Automation**
  - Create fully parametric models that respond to design variable changes
  - Implement design rules and constraints automatically
  - Support for dimensional and geometric constraints

- **Model Modification and Optimization**
  - AI-powered design suggestions and improvements
  - Automatic optimization for manufacturing feasibility
  - Iterative refinement based on design objectives

- **Assembly Constraint Management**
  - Intelligent assembly creation from component specifications
  - Automatic constraint definition and optimization
  - Hierarchical assembly structure support

- **Design Validation and Analysis**
  - Built-in design checks and validation rules
  - Integration with analysis tools (FEA, CFD compatibility)
  - Automated design rule verification

- **Multi-Format Export**
  - Export models in industry-standard formats:
    - STEP (.step, .stp)
    - IGES (.iges, .igs)
    - STL (.stl) for 3D printing
    - BREP (.brep)
    - And more...

## Use Cases

### Mechanical Parts Design
- Rapid prototyping of mechanical components
- Automatic generation of standard parts (fasteners, brackets, etc.)
- Design iteration and optimization

### Assembly Design
- Multi-part assembly generation from specifications
- Constraint-based assembly creation
- Bill of materials generation

### Architectural Design
- Building component modeling
- Interior design layouts
- Structural element creation

### Rapid Prototyping
- Quick concept visualization
- Design validation before manufacturing
- Iterative design exploration

## Quick Start Guide

### Installation

### Basic Usage

```python
# Coming soon - usage examples will be added
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Coming soon - CLI documentation will be provided
```

## Architecture

The CAiD system is composed of several key components:

- **Natural Language Processing Engine**: Interprets design descriptions and requirements
- **Parametric Modeling Core**: Generates and manages parametric CAD models
- **Constraint Solver**: Manages geometric and dimensional constraints
- **Optimization Module**: Improves designs based on specified objectives
- **Export Engine**: Converts models to various industry-standard formats

Detailed architecture documentation is coming soon.
